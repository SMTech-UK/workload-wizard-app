# 🔐 Password Management Guide for Admin User Creation

## Overview

When creating users as an admin, you have several options for handling passwords. This guide explains the different approaches and best practices.

## 🎯 Current Implementation

### **Option 1: Email Invitation (Recommended)**

- ✅ **Default behavior**: Email invitation sent automatically
- ✅ **User experience**: User receives email with sign-in link
- ✅ **Security**: User sets their own password
- ✅ **Clerk integration**: Uses Clerk's built-in email templates

### **Option 2: Temporary Password**

- ✅ **Fallback**: Generated temporary password
- ✅ **Admin control**: You can see the generated password
- ✅ **User experience**: User must change password on first login
- ✅ **Security**: Temporary password is secure but needs changing

## 🔧 How It Works

### **1. Email Invitation Flow**

```typescript
// When sendEmailInvitation = true (default)
const data: CreateUserData = {
  email: "user@example.com",
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  username: "johndoe",
  password: "", // Will be generated automatically
  role: "staff",
  sendEmailInvitation: true, // Send email invitation
};
```

**What happens:**

1. User is created in Clerk with a generated temporary password
2. Clerk automatically sends an email invitation
3. User clicks the link in their email
4. User sets their own password during first sign-in
5. User can immediately access the system

### **2. Temporary Password Flow**

```typescript
// When sendEmailInvitation = false
const data: CreateUserData = {
  email: "user@example.com",
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  username: "johndoe",
  password: "", // Will be generated automatically
  role: "staff",
  sendEmailInvitation: false, // Don't send email
};
```

**What happens:**

1. User is created in Clerk with a generated temporary password
2. No email is sent
3. Admin needs to communicate the password to the user
4. User signs in with the temporary password
5. User should change password on first login

## 🎨 UI Implementation

### **Form Options**

```tsx
<div className="flex items-center space-x-2">
  <Checkbox
    id="sendEmailInvitation"
    checked={sendEmailInvitation}
    onCheckedChange={(checked: boolean | "indeterminate") =>
      setSendEmailInvitation(checked === true)
    }
  />
  <Label htmlFor="sendEmailInvitation" className="text-sm">
    Send email invitation to user
  </Label>
</div>;

{
  !sendEmailInvitation && (
    <div className="p-3 bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded-md">
      <p className="text-sm text-yellow-800">
        <strong>Note:</strong> A temporary password will be generated. The user
        will need to change it on first login.
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### **1. Email Invitation (Recommended)**

- ✅ **Most secure**: User sets their own password
- ✅ **No password sharing**: No need to communicate passwords
- ✅ **Audit trail**: Email delivery is tracked
- ✅ **User control**: User chooses their own secure password

### **2. Temporary Password**

- ✅ **Immediate access**: User can sign in right away
- ✅ **Admin control**: You control the initial password
- ⚠️ **Security risk**: Password needs to be communicated securely
- ⚠️ **User responsibility**: User must change password

### **3. Password Requirements**

- ✅ **Minimum length**: 8 characters
- ✅ **Complexity**: Includes letters, numbers, and special characters
- ✅ **Clerk validation**: Clerk enforces password policies
- ✅ **Change requirement**: Users should change temporary passwords

## 📧 Email Configuration

### **Clerk Email Templates**

You can customize email templates in the Clerk Dashboard:

1. **Go to Clerk Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to Email Templates**
3. **Customize the "User Invitation" template**
4. **Add your branding and messaging**

### **Example Email Template**

```html
<h2>Welcome to Workload Wizard!</h2>
<p>Hello {{user.first_name}},</p>
<p>
  Your account has been created. Click the button below to set up your password
  and sign in:
</p>
<a href="{{sign_in_url}}" class="button">Set Up Account</a>
<p>If you have any questions, please contact your administrator.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />The Workload Wizard Team</p>
```

## 🚀 Implementation Examples

### **1. Standard User Creation (Email Invitation)**

```typescript
// This is the default behavior
const result = await createUser({
  email: "newuser@company.com",
  firstName: "Jane",
  lastName: "Smith",
  username: "janesmith",
  role: "staff",
  // sendEmailInvitation defaults to true
});
// Result: User created, email sent automatically
```

### **2. User Creation with Temporary Password**

```typescript
const result = await createUser({
  email: "newuser@company.com",
  firstName: "Jane",
  lastName: "Smith",
  username: "janesmith",
  role: "staff",
  sendEmailInvitation: false,
});
// Result: User created, no email sent
// Admin needs to communicate temporary password
```

### **3. Bulk User Creation**

```typescript
const users = [
  { email: "user1@company.com", firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe" },
  { email: "user2@company.com", firstName: "Jane", lastName: "Smith" },
];

for (const user of users) {
  await createUser({
    ...user,
    username: user.email.split("@")[0],
    role: "staff",
    sendEmailInvitation: true, // Send emails to all users
  });
}
```

## 🔍 Audit Logging

All user creation events are automatically logged:

```typescript
// Audit log entry example
{
  action: "create",
  entityType: "user",
  entityId: "user_123",
  entityName: "jane@company.com",
  performedBy: "admin_user_id",
  performedByName: "Admin User",
  details: "User created with role: staff, organisation: org_123, email invitation: sent",
  severity: "info",
  timestamp: 1234567890,
}
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
