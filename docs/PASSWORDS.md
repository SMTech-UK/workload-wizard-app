# Password Management

Admin-created users can be onboarded via email invitation (recommended) or temporary password.

## Options

- Email Invitation (default): user sets password via link
- Temporary Password: fallback; require change on first login

## Best Practices

- Prefer invitations to avoid sharing passwords
- Ensure Clerk email templates are configured
- Enforce complexity and length via Clerk

_See UI examples in `PASSWORD_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md` (now consolidated into this document)._
