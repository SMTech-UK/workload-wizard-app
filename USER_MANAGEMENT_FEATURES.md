## Environment Variables Required

No additional environment variables are required for the current features.

## Security Considerations

### Organisation Management
- Only available to users with `sysadmin` or `developer` roles
- All actions are logged in audit trail
- Soft delete approach preserves all organisation data

### User Deactivation/Reactivation
- Only orgadmin, sysadmin, and developer roles can perform these actions
- Cannot deactivate orgadmin or sysadmin users
- All actions are logged in audit trail
- Soft delete approach preserves all user data

## API Endpoints

No additional API endpoints were added for the current features. All functionality uses existing Convex mutations and queries.

## Components Added

1. `DeactivateConfirmationModal` - Confirmation dialog for user deactivation
2. `EditOrganisationForm` - Modal form for editing organisation details
3. Updated `OrganisationsList` - Added edit functionality and action buttons

## Database Changes

## Future Enhancements

1. **Bulk Operations**: Add ability to deactivate/reactivate multiple users at once
